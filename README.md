# What-To-Watch_next_On-Netflix

This project aims to build a recommendation mechanism within Netflix.
The dataset I used here comes directly from Netflix( Netflix Prize Data) and it contains a text file and a csv file.

This project will use the following processes:
1. Data Loading
2. Data Viewing
3. Data cleaning
4. Data slicing
5. Data mapping
6. Recommend with Pearsons' R correlation ( Recommendation model)

We have used only one dataset but you can use more datasets available in the given link:
